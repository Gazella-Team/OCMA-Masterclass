              The customer obtains full right of use for the specific content

              person who acquires the service, either as a representative of a
              company or as a private individual. If the content is acquired by
              a company, the right to use the service will only follow the
              specific acquirer, who is identified as the contact person for the
              company at the time of acquisition. When the company purchases the
              product, it is not permitted internally within the company to
              redistribute the content to employees or co-owners, as this will
              be considered a breach of the trading conditions. If the need
              arises to use the product by several people within the same
              company/legal entity, contact must be made to request offers for
              the issuance of multiple licenses. If a company or individual has
              already violated the rules for redistribution, before obtaining
              offers for the issuance of multiple licenses, the issuer reserves
              the right to invoice the company for a new license, as this is
              considered a breach of the terms of trade. The customer is hereby
              authorized to do the following: Electronically store the original
              content/template for your own later use (not covered by videos).

              maximum on how much you can earn; these are the benefits of this
              business model. Normally your agency and network grow over time,
              which allows for greater growth while reducing time consumption.
              You therefore have the opportunity to decide for yourself,
              depending on your goals, where you want to go. However, we have
              seen several of the first students close deals of 1 - 4,000 usd
              after just one week and then quit their jobs, as they are now
              earning far more than their old jobs.
